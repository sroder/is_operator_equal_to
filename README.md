The “==” operator compares by checking for equality: if we compare the two person objects above using the == operator, we’d get “both persons are equal” as an answer, since they are carrying the same name value.
The “is” operator, however, compares identities. if we compare the two person objects using the is operator, we’d get “these are two different persons” as an answer. There can be more than one “Sarah” in the world. But they are not the same person. Both will have their unique identities. This is true in Python as well.
